        <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
        <p>In this section of my exercise, I am exploreing how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</p>

        <!-- heading options = (h1, h2, h3, h3, h4, h5, h6) aka the browsers defult rendering for that element  -->
        <h3>Adding headings</h3>
        <p> Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy of the content. You can use heading values
            ranging from a top-level heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. While there are several competing theories
            on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent
            manner, to accurately reflect the importance of your content. It's also important to be consistent in how you
            use headings across your site, so deciding on when and how to use headings is an important part of planning your
            site.
        </p>

        <!-- paragraph tag helps define basic format -->
        <h3>Using paragraphs</h3>
        <p>The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags, and one that you'll use often. It indicates
            a paragraph of text, and should be used for each individual paragraph.</p>

        <!-- line breaks <br> hard return-->
        <h3>Line breaks</h3>
        <p>Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create a new line without using a new paragraph. To
            do that in HTML, you use the line break tag (&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use
            them within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag.</p>
    </div>

    <!--Emphasis for text   -->
    <div class="emph">
        <h3>Emphasizing text</h3>
        <p>Often you will want to emphasize a particular phrase or word within your text. HTML gives you several different tags
            to do this with. In this exercise we'll explore the four most common formatting tags you'll use to emphasize
            content.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>

                <!-- boldTag for bold text <b> -->
                <b>The Bold Tag</b>
            </dt>
            <dd>The bold tag (&lang;b&rang;) is mean to represent a span of text that you wish to set apart stylistically from
                the rest of the text without inferring any type of special relevance or meaning. It was removed in XHTML
                as being solely presentational, but added back to HTML5. As you would expect, browsers typically
                <b>bold</b> this text.</dd>
            <dt>

                <!-- strongTag <strong> -->
                <b>The Strong Tag</b>
            </dt>
            <dd>By using the strong tag (&lang;strong&rang;) you are representing a string of text as having strong importance.
                The text should be considered to be more important than the text surrounding it. It is typically displayed
                as
                <b>bold</b>.</dd>
            <dt>

                <!-- italicTag Italic text <i> -->
                <b>The Italic Tag</b>
            </dt>
            <dd>Like the bold tag, the italic tag (&lang;i&rang;) represents a string of text that is set apart stylistically
                from the text around it. No particular meaning is attached to the text, rather it is rendered in italics.
                Helpful for phrases, terms, or any text that is normally displayed in
                <i>italics</i>.</dd>
            <dt>

                <!-- emphasis on teg <em> -->
                <b>The Emphasis Tag</b>
            </dt>
            <dd>The emphasis tag (&lang;em&rang;), or "em" tag, denotes text that is emphasized more than the text around it.
                Although this tag is usually rendered in
                <i>italics</i>, it shouldn't be used in place of the italics tag, rather it should be used for text that needs
                to emphasized for some reason.</dd>
        </dl>
    </div>

    <!-- html has key words they cant be used. -->
    <div class="special">
        <h3>Displaying special characters</h3>
        <p>Certain characters are reserved for HTML, meaning that you aren't allowed to use them in regular content. Using a
            left angle bracket like this "&lang;" in your code can cause rendering issues in certain situations. Other characters
            are special characters or symbols that might not be available through the keyboard, or are used by other languages.
            To represent those characters in normal text, you can use what are known as named character entities.</p>
        <p>These are special codes that the browser or user agent will then replace with the requested character. The syntax
            for them is relatively straightforward. You start with an ampersand (&amp;) followed by the named entity that
            is then followed by a semicolon. To display an ampersand, for example, you would type in &amp;amp;. This can
            be extremely helpful when displaying &copy; and &trade; symbols, or writing mathematical formulas.</p>
        <p>I found a very thorough list of named character entities on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references">Wikipedia</a>.
            <i>This list is long!</i>
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- html white space -->
    <div class="whitespace">
        <h3>Controlling white space</h3>
        <p>By default, browsers will ignore any white space after the first space. To add additional white space, you must use
            the &amp;nbsp; entity.</p>
        <p>Try it here. Add as much white space as you want here.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that the primary purpose of the non-breaking space is to inform browsers when a line break shouldn't
            occur during a string of text. For example, adding a non-breaking space between Formula One would ensure that
            a line break never occurs that would split up the words Formula and One. To that end, never use the non-breaking
            space character to control paragraph indentations or fake a tab character. CSS should control that type of visual
            formatting.

            <img class="img1" src="./images/img1.jpg" alt="Lowcountry South Carolina">Images are placed on the page through the use of the
            <b>img</b> tag. Images are considered
            <b>replaced content</b>, that is the element is replaced with the asset it references. The image element has several
            important attributes. The
            <b>src</b> attribute is used to tell the browser where to find the image. The
            <b>alt</b> attribute allows you to pass along descriptive text representing the image. This can be used by screen
            readers, or displayed in the event the image fails to load.The
            <b>width</b> and
            <b>height</b> are optional and can be used to pass the dimensions of the image to the browser. If omitted, the browser
            will still display the image at its native width and height. These values can be changed to force the browser
            to size the image differently from it's native size.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="img2" src="./images/img2.jpg" alt="null">Most browser support a wide range of image types. For the most part, you're safe using jpg, png, gif, bmp, and
