       <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
     
       <!-- Content formatting -->
      <h1>Formatting page content</h1>
       <p>In this section of my exercise, I am exploreing how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</p>

       <!-- heading options = (h1, h2, h3, h3, h4, h5, h6) aka the browsers defult rendering for that element  -->
      <h1>Adding headings</h1>
       <p> Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy of the content. You can use heading values ranging from a top-level heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. While there are several competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent  manner, to accurately reflect the importance of your content. It's also important to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding on when and how to use headings is an important part of planning your site.</p>
     
       <!-- paragraph tag helps define basic format -->
      <h1>Using paragraphs</h1>
       <p>The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags, and one that you'll use often. It indicates a paragraph of text, and should be used for each individual paragraph.</p>

       <!-- line breaks <br>-->
      <h1>Line breaks</h1>
       <p>Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create a new line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, you use the line break tag (&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use them within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag.</p>
